## About the Game <a name = "about"></a>
 
Virus Defender is a game where you control a lymphocyte B cell, and your goal is to defend your host from the attack of nasty viruses. You'll shoot all of them down with your antibody bullets to keep your host healthy for as long as possible.  

This game is inspired on the fight we're having against SARS-CoV-2.
